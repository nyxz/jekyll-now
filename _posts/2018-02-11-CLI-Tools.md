title: Everyday CLI tools
---

What are some CLI tools that I personally use almost everyday to help me with common tasks.

Here they are:

* wc
* cut
* grep
* sed
* awk
* sort
* uniq
* tr
* head and tail
* alias
* find
* xargs


wc
====
> Print line, word and byte counts

I found the following options to be most useful to me:

> -c / --bytes
> -m / --chars
> -l / --lines
> -w / --words

Ex. check how much lines the file `/etc/passwd` has:

```
~> wc -l /etc/passwd
     108 /etc/passwd
```

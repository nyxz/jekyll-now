I am a:

* software developer - most of the time I write Java code, but occasionally I also do some front-end development (mostly Angular), system administration, deployments and configuration of various tools. I'd be happily using Python, Scala and Go if the time is right. I have interests in the machine learning field but I don't feel comfortable there, yet.
* amateur photographer - you can find some of my favourite shots on [500px/nyxz](https://500px.com/nyxz)
* sports enthusiast - I love sports. I do play football, I train CrossFit and I do some skiing. I also do: swimming, volleyball, basketball, table tennis, ice skating, climbing, tennis, swing-dancing, cycling, hicking, diving, wind surfing, but unfortunatelly not as often as I want.
* gamer - I am far from the stereotype of a gamer, but I can talk to you about StarCraft II, HearthStone, Poker and board games in general.
